My personal notes on how to optimize and use C - mostly to do with understanding pointers properly


Some points to remember for myself:

Never Trust Input -  Never trust the data you’re given and always validate it.

Prevent Errors -  If an error is possible, no matter how probable, try to prevent it.

Fail Early and Openly Fail early, cleanly, and openly, stating what happened, where, and how to fix
it.

Document Assumptions Clearly -  state the pre-conditions, post-conditions, and invariants.

Prevention over Documentation -  Don’t do with documentation that which can be done with code or
avoided completely.

Automate Everything -  Automate everything, especially testing.

Simplify and Clarify -  Always simplify the code to the smallest, cleanest form that works without
sacrificing safety.

Question Authority -  Don’t blindly follow or reject rules
